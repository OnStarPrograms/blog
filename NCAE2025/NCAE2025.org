* NCAE Regionals and Nationals
The NCAE regionals have concluded, and the University of Florida (UF) Blue teams are gearing up for Nationals. Both teams have reached approximately 400 points, with one UF team preparing to participate in the NCAE Nationals.


* Defending the Web Server and Apache Server
** Pre-engagement
At 11:00 AM EST in the Northwest region, the UF NCAE team 2 gathered, and we began the day with laughter and joy. We divided the network into sections, and I was assigned the Ubuntu-based database with Postgres installed.
This will be a fun experience for everyone sitting together.

** ) 11:00 - Engagement Begins
The flags have raised, and the starter pistol fired, signaling the start of the engagement. We logged in to our respective machines and began system hardening, preparing for the incoming attacks from the red team.
** ) 11:02 - Time is Ticking
Time is already ticking, we log in, 2 minutes already gone. Someone doesn't have their credentials properly set up, that will take atleast 5 mins for them. we don't have enought time to stop. I keep going, trying to connect to webservices. The router is down, I can't update my packages.
** ) 11:05 - No_one around
Time flies away faster before the grace period ends, I find three user accounts with UID 0.
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
cat /etc/passwd | grep ":0:"
root
blackteam_r
no_one
#+END_SRC
"no_one" (get it? no one) should have root except me, we take their access away. sorry no_one. we set their _/bin/bash_ to _/dev/null_ no one is getting access
** ) 11:10 - Lost time
Time flows through sand, I am running out of time. I try to run IPTables. Bash error
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
iptables
Command 'iptables' not found
#+END_SRC
Firewall-d.
Nothing
UFW.
Nothing.
All firewalls compromised. I don't have much time
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
sudo apt install iptables
#+END_SRC
Nothing printed, something is wrong. red team is getting closer.
** ) 11:15 - Changing directions
In an act of desperation I use canonicals SNAP package system and get UFW installed.
*UFW requires IPtables*
Plan backfired. but what about curl.
[[https://netfilter.org/projects/iptables/downloads.html]]
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
curl -O https://netfilter.org/projects/iptables/files/iptables-1.8.11.tar.xz
#+END_SRC
you can download IPTables from the web.
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
iptables -A INPUT -p 5432 -j ACCEPT
iptables -A OUTPUT -p 5432 -j ACCEPT
iptables -A INPUT -j DROP
iptables -A OUTPUT -j DROP
#+END_SRC
(Not all commands used listed)
** ) 11:25 - {filtered}
after running those system commands, attackers already got into my system. I need to ignore them for now, and get our services up.
After starting postgres we Nmapped the system and realized something is wrong within, Nmap is returning "filtered"
- Config Files
  Postgres has Configuration files. something happened to them. we discovered it to have mismatched ports. fixed.
Now its time to stop attackers
** ) 11:50 - Process tracking
Working through the commands we discovered threat actor after threat actor
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
ss -tualn
ss -tulpn
tcpdump
who -u
ps -ejH
#+END_SRC
** ) 12:30 - Safety in numbers
For now my system was safe, There were active threats online, but as systems were running, they become ignored.
Web is having trouble, an hour and 30 minutes have passed, and not even the web port is running.
** ) 12:45 - Highjinks with the Nginks
It took 15 minutes to find the error, a misconfiguration in the nginx server, where it was hogging the port, but couldn't host the site.
** ) 1:00 - Routing around
Another 15 minutes gone, yet another misconfiguration found in the router, port 80 isn't forwarded.
** ) By now everyone started their services
Defense is everything, IPTables installed on the webserver.
Annoyance is best
in the Postgres server for an hour and half we ran
#+BEGIN_SRC python
import subprocess
while(True):
    subprocess.pfork("wall 'I love Red Team <3'")
#+END_SRC
Till the end we continued to defend our system, till the end
** ) 4:30 - In the end
We lost all our systems except port 80, and the Router.
Even with IPTables, both of my systems enacted were severely compromised, and the system keyboard, changed to german.

* At the end of the day, we learned more about the keys of cyber security and team work.
There were so many learning opportunities within this competition to bring to the many more in the future.
1. Trust your teammates
2. There are always multiple ways to the same answer
3. Never be afrad to have fun with the Red team, If they're life becomes more annoying because of you, you become less of a target.
