* Write a Class that follows this format
#+BEGIN_SRC cpp
class IntComp{
 private:
    //Not fully Implemented
    char* memory;
    int counter;
 public:
    IntComp(int);

    IntComp& operator+=(std::vector<int>);
    IntComp& operator++();
    IntComp& operator--();
    void setMemory(char*);

    char* getMemory();
}
#+END_SRC

* Function definitions are below.
a) operator+=()

   Takes in a Vector of $3$ commands that are as follows:
   1. operator ($+,-,*,/$):(0,1,2,3)
   2. value ($0-100$)
   3. Place in Memory to store

 - ex.
  * Input: {$0, 34, 5$}
  * Memory: [0|0|0|0|0|0]
  * Command: Memory[5] = Memory[counter]+34;
     counter++;

b) operator++()

  Increments $counter$ by 1

c) operator+-()

  Decrement $counter$ by 1

d) setMemory(char*)

  Take in a pointer and set the current memory to the new memory

d) getMemory()

  return the current Memory block



*** Part 2
 * Turn this class into a Template Class.
*** Part 3
 * Manipulate the memory using only \emph{Pointer Arithmatic}
*** Part 4
 * Complete this Challenge on AoC
